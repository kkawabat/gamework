        This is a live demo of the GameWork Framework.
        
        ## How to use
        
        1. Open \`index.html\` in your browser
        2. The demo shows a Tic-Tac-Toe game interface
        3. This demonstrates the UI structure for the framework
        
        ## Framework Files
        
        The compiled framework is available in the \`dist/\` directory.
        
        ## Live Demo
